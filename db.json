The rule and the hubbub over it are part of a debate over a concept known as &ldquo;data localization,&rdquo; in which a country places restrictions on data as a way to gain better control over it and potentially curb the power of international companies. American firms have lobbied hard against data localization rules around the world.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">In India, Visa, Mastercard and American Express, as well as other financial players like Amazon and PayPal, said they needed more time to comply with the order by the country&rsquo;s banking regulator, the Reserve Bank of India.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">The companies told the R.B.I. that their fraud detection and other data processing systems were distributed on machines across the world and could not be quickly redesigned to work in India alone. As an alternative, they offered to store copies of the Indian data in the country for easy access by regulators, tax authorities and law enforcement.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">But the R.B.I. would have none of it. In recent phone calls to the top Indian executives of the major payments companies and in letters to the companies last week, the banking regulator warned that it would take action, including imposing fines, if they missed the Monday night deadline.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Mukesh Aghi, the chief executive of the U.S.-India Strategic Partnership Forum, said the payments companies were frustrated with the regulators. &ldquo;They refuse to sit down and have a discussion,&rdquo; said Dr. Aghi, whose policy group counts the head of Mastercard on its board.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Spokesmen for Visa and American Express declined to comment on their response to the local storage rule. Representatives of Mastercard and the R.B.I. did not respond to multiple requests for comment.</p><div class="StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-p1yi70"><div class="css-4w7y5l"><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Amazon, which operates an India-only payments service that uses elements of its global technology platform, said in a statement: &ldquo;Compliance with local laws and regulation is a top priority for us in all the countries we operate in. We continue to work closely with the regulator towards this.&rdquo;</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">The R.B.I., an agency akin to the Federal Reserve in the United States, has said little about why it decided that Indian financial data must be stored only in India.&nbsp;<a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.rbi.org.in/scripts/NotificationUser.aspx?Id=11244&amp;Mode=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In its April order</a>, it said, &ldquo;In order to ensure better monitoring, it is important to have unfettered supervisory access to data stored with these system providers.&rdquo;</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Its policy changed as other arms of the Indian government &mdash; spurred by both a privacy ruling from the Supreme Court and India-first nationalists in the governing Bharatiya Janata Party &mdash; had begun deliberating over much bigger changes to the country&rsquo;s data, e-commerce and privacy laws.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Those broader proposals, which are unlikely to be passed until after India&rsquo;s national elections in May, are intended to curb the ability of American tech titans to collect, analyze and make money from data they collect inside the country, which is the world&rsquo;s fastest-growing market for new internet users. The rules would also give a leg up to domestic firms like Reliance Jio, a leading telecom provider, and&nbsp;<a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/technology/india-digital-money.html?module=inline">Paytm, a payments company</a>, which are seeking government help as they try to compete with the likes of Google, Facebook, Amazon and Mastercard.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">India&rsquo;s prime minister, Narendra Modi, has portrayed himself abroad as a pro-business leader who welcomes foreign investment. At the same time, the right wing of his party has pushed him to adopt more protectionist, India-first policies to appeal to voters, and law enforcement officials have urged him to make sure they can easily get data on residents when they need it.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">The Trump administration and the bipartisan India caucus of the United States Senate have both urged India to reconsider its data localization campaign, in part because India&rsquo;s own outsourcing companies depend on moving data across borders to offer their services.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">On Friday, the co-chairmen of the India caucus, Senators John Cornyn, Republican of Texas, and Mark Warner, Democrat of Virginia, wrote to Mr. Modi warning that data localization &ldquo;will have negative impacts on the ability of companies to do business in India, may undermine your own economic goals and will likely not improve the security of Indian citizens&rsquo; data.&rdquo;</p></div><aside class="css-13jtjmc"></aside></div><div class="StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-p1yi70"><div class="css-4w7y5l"><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">The same day, Dennis Shea, a deputy United States trade representative and the ambassador to the World Trade Organization,&nbsp;<a class="css-1g7m0tk" title="" href="https://archive.org/details/CSPAN_20181012_140700_Deputy_U.S._Trade_Representative_on_World_Trade_Organization/start/2040/end/2100" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told a Washington audience</a>, &ldquo;We want to have prohibitions on data localization, disciplines to ensure this free flow of data across borders.&rdquo;</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Dr. Aghi, who has helped American financial firms press their case with the Indian government, said top executives of the big payments companies were summoned to a meeting on Wednesday with B.

But R.B.I. officials insisted that the companies meet the Monday night deadline.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">In a follow-up letter to India&rsquo;s finance minister, Arun Jaitley, Dr. Aghi said the R.B.I. had improperly suggested that the foreign financial firms seek assistance from iSpirt, a technology think tank in Bangalore with close ties to the government and Indian financial-services players.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">The only major American company that said it was ready to comply by midnight was Facebook&rsquo;s WhatsApp messaging service.

Plans College for Artificial Intelligence, Backed by $1 Billion","article":"<div class="StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-p1yi70"><div class="css-4w7y5l"><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Every major university is wrestling with how to adapt to the technology wave of artificial intelligence &mdash; how to prepare students not only to harness the powerful tools of A.I., but also to thoughtfully weigh its ethical and social implications. A.I. courses, conferences and joint majors have proliferated in the last few years.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">But the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is taking a particularly ambitious step, creating a new college backed by a planned investment of $1 billion. Two-thirds of the funds have already been raised, M.I.T. said, in announcing the initiative on Monday.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">The linchpin gift of $350 million came from Stephen A. Schwarzman, chief executive of the Blackstone Group, the big private equity firm. The college, called the M.I.T. Stephen A. Schwarzman College of Computing, will create 50 new faculty positions and many more fellowships for graduate students.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">It is scheduled to begin in the fall semester next year, housed in other buildings before moving into its own new space in 2022.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">The goal of the college, said L. Rafael Reif, the president of M.I.T., is to &ldquo;educate the bilinguals of the future.&rdquo; He defines bilinguals as people in fields like biology, chemistry, politics, history and linguistics who are also skilled in the techniques of modern computing that can be applied to them.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">But, he said, &ldquo;to educate bilinguals, we have to create a new structure.&rdquo;</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Academic departments still tend to be silos, Mr. Reif explained, despite interdisciplinary programs that cross the departmental boundaries. Half the 50 faculty positions will focus on advancing computer science, and the other half will be jointly appointed by the college and by other departments across M.I.T.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Traditionally, departments hold sway in hiring and tenure decisions at universities. So, for example, a researcher who applied A.I.-based text analysis tools in a field like history might be regarded as too much a computer scientist by the humanities department and not sufficiently technical by the computer science department.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">M.I.T.&rsquo;s leaders hope the new college will alter traditional academic thinking and practice.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">&ldquo;We need to rewire how we hire and promote faculty,&rdquo; said Martin Schmidt, the provost of M.I.T.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Today, most dual-major programs involve taking courses in a computer science department in machine learning or data science in addition to a student&rsquo;s major. The M.I.T. college is an effort to have computing baked into the curriculum rather than stapled on. It will grant degrees, though what they will be or their names have not been determined.</p><div class="css-4w7y5l"><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">That appealed to Melissa Nobles, dean of M.I.T.&rsquo;s School of Humanities, Arts and Social Sciences, who said she saw the new college as helping non-computer scientists bring A.I. tools to their fields &mdash; &ldquo;to what they really care about.&rdquo;</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">The college, Ms. Nobles said, offers the possibility of a renewal for humanities studies at M.I.T., where students flock to computer science and engineering.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">&ldquo;We&rsquo;re excited by the possibilities,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s how the humanities are going to survive, not by running from the future but by embracing it.&rdquo;</p><div class="StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-p1yi70"><div class="css-4w7y5l"><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Donors, like students, are attracted more to computer science programs than to many other disciplines. But the new college at M.I.T. is designed to spread the wealth.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a major fund-raising mechanism that gives M.I.T. a huge resource to apply A.I. to other fields,&rdquo; said Eric Schmidt, who was the executive chairman of Alphabet, the parent company of Google, and is a visiting innovation fellow at M.I.T.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">The college and its goals were shaped by a long-running conversation between Mr. Schwarzman, the principal donor, and Mr. Reif, the M.I.T. president. They first met in 2015 when Mr. Schwarzman was setting up the Schwarzman Scholars program, which awards scholarships for young people to gain a greater understanding of China.</p></div><aside class="css-13jtjmc"></aside></div><div class="StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-p1yi70"><div class="css-4w7y5l"><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">At the time, Mr. Schwarzman was becoming increasingly fascinated by the debate over the opportunity and challenge presented by artificial intelligence. A lengthy conversation with Jack Ma, founder of the Chinese e-commerce giant Alibaba, piqued his interest, Mr. Schwarzman recalled, and he kept talking to experts and reading.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">&ldquo;I became convinced that this technology was so powerful it was really going to remake a lot of the world as we know it,&rdquo; he said.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Over the next few years, Mr. Schwarzman and Mr. Reif picked up the conversation about the trajectory of A.I. and its broad impact, when their paths crossed in places like New York and Davos, Switzerland.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Over the past year, M.I.T.&rsquo;s leaders and faculty were brainstorming to chart a course for the university&rsquo;s future. The university had done individual initiatives in areas like the future of work and a research project on the human and machine intelligence.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">But Mr. Schwarzman urged Mr. Reif to go further, emphasizing the ethical issues raised by automated decision-making in everything from medical diagnosis to self-driving cars. He also stressed the workplace impact.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">&ldquo;We really need to try to understand this technology, not just get hit by it,&rdquo; Mr. Schwarzman said.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Meanwhile, Mr. Reif was also focused on making a universitywide impact. His persistent question: &ldquo;How do I make sure these tools are used by everyone in every discipline?&rdquo;</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">The new college structure was his answer. Mr. Schwarzman said he would be interested in contributing, and soon after, Mr. Reif made his pitch.</p></div><aside class="css-13jtjmc"></aside></div><div class="StoryBodyCompanionColumn css-p1yi70"><div class="css-4w7y5l"><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">&ldquo;Well, that is a big number,&rdquo; Mr. Schwarzman said, recalling his initial reaction.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">After further study, he said yes.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">Mr. Schwarzman said he hoped that the M.I.T. move might trigger others to invest in America&rsquo;s A.I. future, not just commercially. He points to the major push the Chinese government is making, and notes the fruits of United States government-funded research in the past &mdash; technologies that helped America take the global lead in industries from the personal computer to the internet.</p><p class="css-1xl4flh e2kc3sl0">&ldquo;I think we&rsquo;ve been lagging, for whatever reason,&rdquo; Mr. Schwarzman said.</p></div></div></div></div><aside class="css-13jtjmc"></aside></div><div class="css-1597c7c e1am8aqz0"><div class="css-1274r9c e1am8aqz1">&nbsp;</div></div>","imgurl":"https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/10/16/business/16mit-1/merlin_145234875_ebe023b3-3844-4a57-b2c7-590824893fe7-superJumbo.jpg?quality=90&auto=webp","category":"POLITICS","summary":"The goal, said L.

Then there was Dodgers catcher Yasmani Grandal, two pitches later, letting a knuckle-curve bounce away from him to turn that triple into a Brewers run. And there were the Dodgers, fumbling through the top of the sixth inning, gifting a run they could not afford to gift given how flat they were in an eventual 4-0 loss Monday night at Dodger Stadium.</p><p data-elm-loc="3">Those miscues helped give the Brewers a two-games-to-one lead in the National League Championship Series, and showed all the ways this matchup is tilting in their favor. They got 5⅓ scoreless innings from Jhoulys Chacin, even though starting pitching is supposed to be the Dodgers&rsquo; biggest advantage. They kept tapping into unlikely sources of offense, with shortstop Orlando Arcia smacking his second home run of the series and third of the playoffs after he hit just three in 119 regular season games.</p><p data-elm-loc="4">And they kept shutting down the Los Angeles offense, which gave no support to starter Walker Buehler before folding in front of Corey Knebel, Joakim Soria, Josh Hader and Jeremy Jeffress of the Brewers&rsquo; shutdown bullpen.</p><p data-elm-loc="5">&ldquo;In the playoffs, you got to want it, and today just wasn&rsquo;t our day,&rdquo; Dodgers second baseman Enrique Hernandez said. &ldquo;We had no energy, the stadium had no energy, the fans had no energy, so overall it was a pretty bad day for everybody that calls themselves Dodgers.&rdquo;</p><p class="interstitial-link " data-elm-loc="6"><em>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/10/15/magic-dust-spin-rates-buy-in-how-astros-make-good-pitchers-even-better/?utm_term=.3a61c7c39aa7">Magic dust, spin rates and buy-in: How the Astros make good pitchers even better</a>]</em></p><p data-elm-loc="7">The Dodgers are a team burdened by expectation, whether the players will admit that, or whether it even matters once the hitter digs in, the pitcher gets set and the ball is thrown. Clayton Kershaw carries past postseason failures into every one of his playoff starts. Shortstop Manny Machado was brought to Los Angeles for this very stretch, as baseball&rsquo;s biggest midseason acquisition, as the Dodgers&rsquo; last puzzle piece, and peak performance is anticipated. This team made it to the World Series in 2017, so anything short of that, as they still sit three wins away from a return, will be seen as a failure.</p><p data-elm-loc="8">And that all thickened Monday night, for the players and the coaches and the fans who bristled in their seats, stewing to themselves until there was something new to yell about. Buehler gave up a first-inning run, on a Ryan Braun double, then held that deficit in place for four innings by pushing the radar gun with 98- and 99-mph fastballs. But the Los Angeles offense offered nothing in return.</p><p data-elm-loc="9">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s the playoffs. It&rsquo;s heightened. Every mistake you can kind of see,&rdquo; Buehler said. &ldquo;So I got to be better.&rdquo;</p><p class="interstitial-link " data-elm-loc="10"><em>[<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/sports/2018/10/15/matt-wieters-could-return-nationals-though-starting-role-is-quite-unlikely/?utm_term=.61c8944ab0c5">Matt Wieters could return to the Nationals, though a starting role is quite unlikely</a>]</em></p><p data-elm-loc="11">Chacin used groundouts instead of strikeouts. He let hitters get themselves out. He pushed through the fifth inning even with Brewers Manager Craig Counsell ready to go to the bullpen at any time, because his pitch count was low and the Dodgers could not hit him before he exited with one out in the sixth.</p><p data-elm-loc="12">Soon Bellinger misread Travis Shaw&rsquo;s triple, Grandal couldn&rsquo;t handle the ball in the dirt that brought Shaw home, and Arcia homered an inning later, sneaking a high-arcing two-run shot inside the right field line to take any remaining air out of the ballpark. Buehler&rsquo;s night finished after seven innings, eight strikeouts and four earned runs that his teammates could not match. They went hitless in 10 at-bats with runners in scoring position and couldn&rsquo;t muscle the home runs that powered their offense throughout the regular season.</p><p data-elm-loc="13">&ldquo;Home runs aren&rsquo;t there,&rdquo; Bellinger said. &ldquo;And when the home runs aren&rsquo;t there, we have to find a way to score without hitting the home run. Myself included, we have to have better at-bats. You can&rsquo;t really do anything about it now. You have to show up [Tuesday] and beat these guys.&rdquo;</p><p data-elm-loc="14">In the first two games of the series, the Dodgers did not score before the seventh inning and yet sparked a comeback each time. In Game 1, their push fell one run short but showed that they could produce against the Milwaukee bullpen. In Game 2, the late rally ended with a two-run homer from Justin Turner that helped the Dodgers knot the series before heading home.</p><p class="interstitial-link " data-elm-loc="15"><em>[<a href="http://stats.washingtonpost.com/mlb/boxscore.asp?final=true&amp;gamecode=381015119">Monday&rsquo;s box score: Brewers 4, Dodgers 0</a>]</em></p><p data-elm-loc="16">In Game 3, it only came with an empty ninth-inning rally that ended when Brian Dozier struck out looking to leave the bases loaded. That was it. The fans stayed quiet before then, at least for the most part, at least until Grandal dropped an Alex Wood fastball that allowed Braun to take second base.</p><p data-elm-loc="17">There was one out in the eighth inning at that point. It was Grandal&rsquo;s third passed ball of the series and it came after a dismal defensive performance in Game 1.
